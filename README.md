# Formants
Inspired by [Dr. Geoff Lindsey's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdldD0-kEcc) recent video. To install, you need:
- Python 3
- Numpy
- PyGame
- PyAudio
Then you click around the plot to hear the very robotic unnatural vowels. The chart used is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant).
